			<h4>Failure is a Good Sign</h4>
			<p>Many people try to avoid failing, but in reality failure is a sign that you pushed past your limits and are stretching yourself to reach beyond those limits. If you aren't failing from time to time, you probably aren't pushing yourself as hard as you could.</p>

			<p>So don't think of failure as a sign to stop, but as a signal that you should keep trying! (tho probably try it in a different way this time)</p>

			<h4>Don't Burn Out</h4>
			<p>When I'm learning a new thing or tackling a new project, it's easy to just throw my effort, time and attention into that project. And that's a good thing! But. If you don't learn to turn that off, you'll end up exhausted, mentally wasted, and completely burned out.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>So remember that it's okay, even good, to rest. Give yourself permission to do so. And remember, rest for the mind is just as important as rest for the body, and the two often look very different. Explore ways to rest that are unique to you!</p>
